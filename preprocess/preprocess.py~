# This is a general preprocessor for transforming the raw academic dataset
# into a form that is usable by our various training programs. It needs as
# input:
#    * the path to the dataset 
#    * a function "categorize" which analyzes a review and determines its
#      category.
#
# The output will be a list of items of the form (category, text)
#
